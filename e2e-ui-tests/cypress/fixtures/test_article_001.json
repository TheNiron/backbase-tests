    "article_content": "*Animals are often the forgotten victims of conflicts and wars.*  In particular, zoo animals in Ukraine have found themselves trapped in the middle of a terrifying conflict through no fault of their own. This has led to the prospect of some zoos stating that they will have to euthanise many of their animals[2], which has led to a despairing outcry, and rightly so. Zoo animals are trapped by design. They are either taken or bred in an environment that’s not their natural habitat, and forced into enclosures so that they can’t escape, for the benefit of paying visitors. This leads to tragedy when their enclosures are no longer in a safe place and the income dries up as we have seen in in Ukraine."
